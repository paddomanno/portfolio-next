# Personal Portfolio Website using Next.js

This is a personal portfolio website showcasing selected projects to demonstrate my learning progress. It also serves as a personal learning project to familiarize myself with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) , which includes Next.js 13, TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, NextAuth, and Tailwind.

The website is a frontend-only application, with data (project descriptions, my personal tech stack, etc.) stored as JSON. The live demo of this project is currently hosted [here](https://portfolio-next-git-main-paddomannos-projects.vercel.app/) via Vercel.

Feel free to explore and get in touch if you have any questions or feedback!
